## Overview

The goal of this personal project is to set up an Automated Email Notificaion mechanism that reads the latest Questions and Answers published on SAP Developer Community to specified email ids of users. Using data on questions and answeres scrapped from Sap.com, core content of the email is generated.

Read Sap Community Network(SCN) Questions by using Python3 Libaries in less than 10 lines of code.

Would it be interesting if we could automate the task of monitoring a website of interest to check for possible updates?
This partcular application written in Python3 achieves the task of reading the SCN community for latest questins being asked.

Can be tailored for further useful HTML tags.:relaxed:
